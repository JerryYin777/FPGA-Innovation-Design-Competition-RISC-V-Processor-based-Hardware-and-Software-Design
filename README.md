## FPGA Innovation Design Competition:RISC-V-Processor based Hardware and-Software Design
  
This is our repo for FPGA Innovation Design Competition,we made a RISC-V CPU processor-based software and hardware design in PGL22G FPGA development board and the Maximum operating frequency up to 47MHz, performance up to 1.915CoreMark/MHz, consuming 0.3392w power.
The main branch is the source project of Pango Design Suit, th master branch is Tinyriscv's source file.
## Use
To use  this riscv, pleace open the project in Pango Design Suit, and the folllowing steps are the same as in tinyriscv.
